Short:        chunky2planar as an Amiga shared library
Author:       Alimede Informatica
Uploader:     Gabriele Budelacci <g.bude@alimede.com>
Type:         dev/misc
Version:      1.9
Requires:     68020+
Architecture: m68k-amigaos >= 1.2


overview
-----------------------------

  - c2p.library is a fast lowlevel Amiga shared library for chunky2planar
    conversion.

  - c2p.library is designed to run the core loop entirely into the CPU
    instruction cache, resulting a very fast conversion.

  - being a standard Amiga shared library, you can use c2p.library with
    your favourite development language.

  - c2p.library can convert chunky data in any resolution, up to 2 Mpx.

  - c2p.library is released under the MIT license.



features
-----------------------------

  - convert 8 bit chunky buffer to 1-8 bitplanes planar Bitmap
  - fully OS compliant
  - automatic CPU detection to select the best conversion algorithm
  - sources included
  - fully documented
  - supplied with SDK for C, Assembly and Amiga E
  - free to use, for any personal or commercial software



requirements
-----------------------------

  - os1.2 (v33) or newer
  - CPU 68020 or greater



recent changes
-----------------------------

v1.9
    - avoids pipeline stalls in the conversion on the 68040/060 CPUs.

v1.8
    - custom memory manager, which ensures backward compatibility of
      the code back to AmigaOS 1.2 (still requires a 68020+ CPU).

v1.7
    - improved conversion speed (up to +20%) for 1, 2 and 3 bitplanes.

v1.6
    - if available, use Akiko chip (Amiga CD32) for c2p conversion.

v1.5.1
    - fixed an issue in the delta conversion writeback algorithm.

v1.5
    - added support for delta conversion: convert only the pixels
      that are modified in new frame.

v1.4
    - added support for interleaved bitmaps as target of c2p
      conversion.

v1.3
    - you can choose to convert only a limited number of chunky
      pixels, selecting them using a source offset and placing the
      result using a destination offset (eg: useful for chunky
      Blitter objects).

v1.2
    - ability to use custom bitmaps.

v1.1
    - optimized conversion algorithm for processors with bigger
      instruction cache (Motorola 68040 or greater).

v1.0
    - first public release.
